# MaxPixels Website
A website about and created by yours truly.

This is my very first website that taught me about HTML. It was very easy and fun to make and I hope I can make more and better websites in the future.

# Can I use this?
I'm not stopping you. I mean this just something anyone can make. However, if you're just making small changes (text, icons, etc), I recommend crediting me. But to be honest, I don't think your gonna use this. Right?
